Data Visualization Class

Challenge Assignment 1

Two formulas were used in the excel file that were not shown during class instruction. Both are in the main workbook titled Crowdfunding. 
First in columns N & O, the date conversion formula was found at (https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/2473-excel-timestamp-to-date.html).
Second, columnes S & T, the formula to split text from column R were found at (https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/excel-substring-functions-extract-text/comment-page-1/).

On Workbook titled Statistical Analysis: 
**Variance and Standard Deviation are of the sample sets on this workbook and not the entire population because the ask was to isolate the sample sets of "successful" and "failed" outcomes from the whole population and analyze them in isolation from the entire population. To accomplish this formula =VAR.S() was used for the variance and formula =STDEV.S() was used for the Standard Deviation.
